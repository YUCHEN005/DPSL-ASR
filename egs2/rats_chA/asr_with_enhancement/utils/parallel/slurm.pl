# In general, doing 
#  slurm.pl some.log a b c 
# is like running the command a b c as an interactive SLURM job, and putting the 
# standard error and output into some.log.
# It is a de-facto-mimicry of run.pl, with the difference, that it allocates the
# jobs on a slurm cluster, using SLURM's salloc.
#
# To run parallel jobs (backgrounded on the host machine), you can do (e.g.)
#  slurm.pl JOB=1:4 some.JOB.log a b c JOB is like running the command a b c JOB
# and putting it in some.JOB.log, for each one. [Note: JOB can be any identifier].
# If any of the jobs fails, this script will fail.

# A typical example is:
#  slurm.pl some.log my-prog "--opt=foo bar" foo \|  other-prog baz
# and slurm.pl will run something like:
# ( my-prog '--opt=foo bar' foo |  other-prog baz ) >& some.log
# 
# Basically it takes the command-line arguments, quotes them
# as necessary to preserve spaces, and evaluates them with bash.
# In addition it puts the command line at the top of the log, and
# the start and end times of the command at the beginning and end.
# The reason why this is useful is so that we can create a different
# version of this program that uses a queueing system instead.
#
# You can also specify command-line options that are passed to SLURM's
# salloc, e.g.:
#
# slurm.pl -p long -c 4 --mem=16g JOB=1:4 some.JOB.log a b c JOB
#
# The options "-p long -c 4 --mem=16g" are passed to salloc. In general, all
# options of form "-foo something" and "--fii" (and also "-V") are recognized
# as options that must be passed to salloc (yes, this is a bit hacky).
#
# In addition to that, the script also converts an option like '-pe smp N'
# to a form '-c N'. This is because some Kaldi's scripts use this SGE syntax
# to specify the number of CPU cores for a job.
