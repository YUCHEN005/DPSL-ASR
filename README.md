## Introduction

DPSL-ASR is a novel method for end-to-end noise-robust speech recognition. It extends our prior work IFF-Net (Interactive Feature Fusion Network) with dual-path inputs and style learning, which achieves better ASR performance on [RATS Channel-A dataset](https://github.com/YUCHEN005/RATS-Channel-A-Speech-Data) and CHiME-4 1-Channel Track Dataset.

## Usage

Our code implementation is based on [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet). You can intall it directly using our provided ESPnet(v.0.9.6) folder, or install from official website and then add files from our repo. Use the command `pip install -e .` to install ESPnet.

In our folder, the running scripts are at `egs2/rats_chA/asr_with_enhancement/{run_rats_chA_dpsl_asr, rats_chA_dpsl_asr}.sh`, and the network code are at `espnet2/{asr/, enh/, layers/}`. 

**Tips**: 

1. To go over the entire project, please start from the script `egs2/rats_chA/asr_with_enhancement/run_rats_chA_dpsl_asr.sh`
2. To read the network code only, please start from the script `espnet2/asr/dpsl_asr.py`
